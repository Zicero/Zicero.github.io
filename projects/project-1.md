In ICS 111, this Pong project was one of my first experiences making a simple game in Java. The goal of the game is to keep the ball (the probe) above the paddle (lightsaber) for as long as possible. The score is based on how many times you hit the ball, but the difficulty slightly increases each time that happens.

The Pong project helped to bring my Java knowledge to life. Although it was a very simple game, it was still very rewarding to see a few lines of code turn into something visual and enjoyable. I was able to learn a little about game design, Java program structure, and that projects like these can take up a lot of time.
