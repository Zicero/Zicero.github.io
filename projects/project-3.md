summary: A text-based UI for a address book program I made in ICS 212.
---

This project was created during my time in ICS 212. The goal of the address book project was to create a text-based UI for an address book that stored names and addresses. The program itself allowed users to list a certain address based on an id, list all addresses, and add/delete addresses. 

The address book was my first project I coded in C. During the week and a half I spent creating it, I learned how to solve coding challenges when dealing with memory leaks, pointers, and the occasional syntax error. It was interesting working in C after using Java in ICS 111 and 211. Learning C helped me understand how computers store information, the basics of program structure, and the advantages of using C instead of Java.
