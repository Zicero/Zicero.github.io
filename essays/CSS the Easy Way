UI Framworks give users the power to create beautiful and clean user interfaces. The best part is that there are so many out there to choose from.
Im my software engineering couse, we are learning how to use Semantic UI. Prior to this class I have been exposed to Bootstrap, Material, and 
Semantic and I must say that I had the best experience with Semantic so far. Its easier to pick up, nicer, responsive, and it just makes sense. 
Bootstrap comes in at a close second simply because it has a lot of the same elements that Semantic has that makes it great. Semantic can do everything Bootstrap does 
and more. Material is still a great tool to have, but I just had problems with it and found myself switching over to Semantic to make it easier for me.

While UI Frameworks take a lot of the boring CSS work out, its still great to know raw HTML and CSS. Its impossible to onlu know Semantic 
and know nothing about HTML and CSS. Semantic can be a great tool to make your life easier, but you are still very limited in what you can do with it. 
Combining your knowledge of HTML, CSS, and a UI Framework allows you to do some really cool things that you couldn't do before. So, take the 
time to learn the basics before learning a UI Framework.

For me, learning Semantic UI has improved my quality of life. It made me realize what crazy things can be built in such a short amount of time. 
Semantic also showed me how much power I have to create new and cool things. So, with that in mind I urge you to try out Semantic and see how it works for you.
