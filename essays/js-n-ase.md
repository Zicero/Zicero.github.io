I started to learn Javascript in a high school coding class. The whole purpose of the class was to fimilarize
ourselves with a programming language. Our daily ritual consisted of a half hour session of [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/).
I know that this doesn't sound very exciting, but it proved to be extremely useful in many ways. About a year later, I found myself in ICS 111
learning Java. My past experience with Javascript made the class seem like a breeze. Yes, learning a language makes it easier to learn others, 
but theres a reason why its called Javascript. They are very similar to each other. Javascript is a great language to start off with, really
easy to use, and an extremely popular language. It does have a few design flaws, but its still a good language to learn. 

You thought software engineering was easy? Well, heres athletic software engineering! 
When we think of a professional athlete, we know that they put in a lot of effort and practice constantly to maintain their status of being the best. 
So, if we want to be the best software engineers we can be we need to practice. Push ourselves out of our comfort zone so we can improve.
In ICS 314 we have "workouts of the day" or WODs. In these WODs, we are given a problem and have a time limit to solve it. The style of the WODs
resemble a coding interview. If you've ever been in one, you know that its high stress. The WODs in class are high stress, but the goal is to 
become comfortable enough with these problems so we don't panic when we get to a real coding interview. I felt that the practiice WODs were useful 
to guage where I stand, but one little mistake during the real WODs can through you off. While I may hate it at first, I know that with enough practice 
I'll be able to be calm, collected, and prepared in the future.
