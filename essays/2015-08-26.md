When I was little, the first interaction I had with a computer was my dadâ€™s desktop. It was a bulky machine with a big box-like white monitor. Every once in awhile I was lucky enough to use the computer to play a Tonka game and an army man game. Ever since then I've always been fascinated what computers can do. Throughout my entire childhood, I've spent hours upon hours messing around with a Stick Pivot creator, playing what seemed like endless amounts of browser games, and watching youtube videos. At that moment in time, I thought I knew how computers worked. Boy was I wrong. 

The first time I learned about code I was both awe struck and very confused by what I had seen. I never would have guessed thats how software engineers created all those cool apps I was previously using. I wanted so badly to create something of my own, but how? During this time of my life I was really into Minecraft. No suprise there. Minecraft plugins were super popular and according to my Google searches they were on the easier side to make. That began my first attempt at software engineering. 

Today, I'm taking a software engineering class and I got a job in web development. Over the last few months that I've had the job I can say without a doubt that I learned a lot. I've had a lot of experience implementing and managing software, and I still have only scratched the surface. I hope by the end of this year to learn a lot more about design and good practices to improve upon my experiences. The journey has only just begun.
