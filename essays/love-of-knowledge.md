Lets face it. Theres been several times where we as computer scientists have been stuck staring at a 
piece of code and can't find a solution. Sometimes we just need a break to reset, but when it gets 
tough we tend to turn to the same source for solutions: [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). 
StackOverflow is great due to the countless number of previously answered questions and the community is filled 
with extremely smart individuals that can help. However, these individuals can be picky as to which questions 
are "worthy" of their time. Bad questions exist and people will not hesitate to downvote or call them out.
In order to increase our chances of having our question answered, we need to follow a few guidelines.

A "smart" question should have a good subject header or title. 

A "smart" question should be precise and informative. 

A "smart" question should express the author's thirst for knowledge.
